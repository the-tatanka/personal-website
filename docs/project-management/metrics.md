# Metrics

Project management metrics remove uncertainty so that we can make well informed decisions.

The shown definitions are from [Workfront](https://www.workfront.com/project-management/metrics).

## Key Performance Indicator (KPI)

In addition to agile metrics, there are other general business metrics.

A KPI is a measurable value that illustrates how effectively a company / team is performing towards key business objectives.

KPIs are wonderful tools, but only when quantifiable goals are set in advance. Ojectives and key results (OKRs) are an essential tool for defining goals.

Measure what matters - if you're collecting data just for the sake of having more graphs, then ditch that KPI!

<details>
<summary>Expand KPI examples to see what KPIs can be for different teams:</summary>

- Marketing KPIs: Qualified leads, Conversion rate, Social media followers

- Public relations KPIs: Web coverage, News coverage, Share of voice

- Online marketing KPIs: Average cost per lead (CPL), Number of conversions, PPC or AdWord CTR, Website or landing page conversion rate

- Content marketing KPIs: Recurring visitors, Blog comments, Blog shares

- Engineering KPIs: Sprint points, Progress vs. schedule (deadlines successfully met?), P-O or P-1 active bugs in production, Rework

- Architecture improvements: Quality assurance KPIs, Number of P-0 or P-1 bugs in product, Covered project requirements, Passed tests

- Product management KPIs: Product engagement rate, Customer NPS from product feedback, Customer retention, Customer complaints

- Customer success KPIs: Customer NPS score, Customer satisfaction (CSAT) score, Customer retention rate, Customer churn

- Customer support KPIs: Average response time, Average resolution time, Incident rate

- Customer retention KPIs: Customer satisfaction, Net promoter score (NPS), CSAT score

- Operations KPIs: Labor utilization (employee ROI), Project schedule variance (missed deadlines), Rework

## Objectives and Key Results (OKR)

An OKR is a simple tool to align and engage everyone at the company around measurable goals.

Think of the objective in OKRs as a "strategic theme", a broad, overarching, qualitative headline of what is to be achieved. The objective’s key results resemble KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). The key result can be either a metric or a measurable milestone.

Limit OKRs to 3-5 objectives (per department, team, or individual) and 1-3 KRs per objective. Any more and you could lose focus or become disengaged. No one should have more than 3-5 objectives per quarter, with 1-3 key results per objective.

OKRs must encompass SMART goal criteria: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.

### Objectives

An objective states what you want to achieve. It's a title that names a set or a group of Key Results. Consider your most important business priorities.

Each objective has 1-3 key results which measure success against the objective.

Google suggests: “Use expressions that convey endpoints and states, e.g., "climb the mountain", "eat 5 pies", "ship feature Y".

John Doerr’s formula is a great place to start. "I will accomplish 'Objective' as measured by 'Key Result'."

### Key Results

A key result (KR) is what measures the progress of the goal. A key result is owned by the individual who is assigned the goal.

KRs will be owned by the junior-most hierarchy of employees who are in the system and have been assigned goals. These employees will own the key results and will update performance.

Google suggests: "Key results should describe outcomes, not activities."

KR characteristics are:

- Quantitative, the "target" that you seek (it is not a task)

- Answer "how" you will achieve the objective, or how you will know if you succeeded

- Very similar to a KPI (Key Performance Indicator)

- Measurable - can be milestones qualitative, but measurable by "omplete/Incomplete" or by % attainment or by a quantified with a number ($ or monetary value, # of units, etc.)

- Time-Based - always assign a deadline to every key result.

### OKR Mistakes

- Creating unachievable objectives

- Failing to designate a DRI (directly responsible individual)

- Setting only top-down objectives (-> some should also come from the bottom up)

- Authoring OKRs using vague language

- Failing to track progress weekly

- Assigning only aspirational or operational objectives

- Having too many objectives

- Poor resource allocation
