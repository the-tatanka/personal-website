## Z-Model for problem solving

A common approach to problem solving can enhance a group’s ability to make decisions together.

The image below shows a modified version of the Z-Model from Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.

The original approach suggests the following methodology:

> We start use Sensing (1) to identify the facts, raw data, VOCs, KPIs. But we know that this is not enough and we need to examine the data voice, place it in the context of prior experiences, and exploring either current and new ways of viewing the problem, by using Intuition (2).
>
> Now we use a Thinking (3) judgment to analyze the consequences of the various options we have generated. Finally, we apply our Feeling (4) judgment to consider the effects of each option, and incorporate the values of people involved.

The following questions can help to formulate the individual steps.

### 1. Problem

- What specific data is available about the situation?

- What does experience tell us?

- What are the realistic constraints?

- What incremental steps have already been taken?

- What facts describe where we are?

### 2. Goal

- What is the goal?

- What must be the outcome?

- How will we objectively assess progress and success?

### 3. Solution Options

- What needs to be considered in assessing the options?

- What are the best options, with their pros and cons?

- What are the fundamental assumptions underlying the options?

- What are the logical consequences of implementing each option?

- How does each option contribute to the desired goal?

- Again - How will we objectively assess progress and success?

### 4. Decision

- With whom do we need to collaborate and in what ways?

- How will people feel about the implementation of the selected option?

- How will our stakeholders react?

- Which solutions will promote maximum acceptance and ownership?

- Is the option consistent with our values?

- Who will be affected by the implementation of the option(s)?

- How will we communicate with others about the selected option?

- Are there other parties to the solution who should be included?
