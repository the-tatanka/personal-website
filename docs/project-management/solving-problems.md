## Z-Model for problem solving

A common approach to problem solving can enhance a group’s ability to make decisions together.

![Modified Z-Model](/img/z-model.png)

Keep in mind:

- What can we clarify/implement ourselves?

- Where do we need support?

- What do we have to live with?

### 1. Problem

- What specific data is available about the situation?

- What does experience tell us?

- What are the realistic constraints?

- What incremental steps have already been taken?

- What facts describe where we are?

### 2. Goal

- What is the goal?

- What must be the outcome?

- How will we objectively assess progress and success?

### 3. Solution Options

- What needs to be considered in assessing the options?

- What are the best options, with their pros and cons?

- What are the fundamental assumptions underlying the options?

- What are the logical consequences of implementing each option?

- How does each option contribute to the desired goal?

- Again - How will we objectively assess progress and success?

### 4. Decision

- With whom do we need to collaborate and in what ways?

- How will people feel about the implementation of the selected option?

- How will our stakeholders react?

- Which solutions will promote maximum acceptance and ownership?

- Is the option consistent with our values?

- Who will be affected by the implementation of the option(s)?

- How will we communicate with others about the selected option?

- Are there other parties to the solution who should be included?
