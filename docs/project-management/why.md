# Why

Let me paint a picture of the not-so-cool problem.

Designers generally create sites — using multiple layers, prototypes, and files to show different pages, hover states, and screen sizes. Then, after repeated discussion between stakeholders (and awaiting approval), they are getting passed off to an <i>unrelated</i> developer.

Back-and-forth is required when they ask for clarification on your requirements / details, when they ultimately point out technical limitations, and simply when they deviate from the design as prescribed. Depending on the extent of the changes, the client might have to get involved again, leading to a sometimes annoying push-and-pull.

Depending on how big a change is, this could even require getting approval from the client again — which not only could increase development time, but could also make them lose confidence in you.

This is inefficient. Repetitious back-and-forth can easily increase development time several-fold. Therefore, you need project management to structure the whole thing.

Project management describes the project activities to meet the project requirements.

All projects share a few common qualities:

- Unique

- Planned goal(s)

- Success is measured in terms of output, outcome, value, or benefits

- Constraints typically include time, scope, and cost
