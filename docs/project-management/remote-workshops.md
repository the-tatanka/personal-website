# Remote Workshops

NN/g lists the following challenges regarding remote workshops.

## Receiving Feedback

Respondents complained about:

- Unsatisfactory tools for gathering feedback

- Delayed feedback

- Too much formality in the process of gathering feedback

- Lowered confidence due to working in isolation

Advice:

- Prepare files in advance with tools that your team is comfortable and able to use

- Choosing the right tools can make it easier to provide feedback: Look for a low entry barrier so that nondesigners can easily accomplish their tasks.

- Select one tool rather than a collection of tools: Using a single tool minimizes the chance that people will be lost in the process.

- Set a timeline for feedback collection and stick to it

## Replicating Hallway Conversations

Respondents mentioned:

- Difficulty of replicating short, informal conversations remotely

- Feeling disconnected from their teams

Advices:

- Set a recurring time for the team to meet with the intention of collaborating: Work together on anything that’s needed - as the team gets used to it, this meeting won’t be seen as forced.

- Start meetings with an informal discussion to allow team members time to build relationships

- Try a full-day video conference to replicate in-office communication: No formal agenda, but team members can unmute when they want to ask a question or work through a design problem together in the moment without having to schedule a separate meeting. Consider starting with a quarter- or half-day and only do this occasionally.

## Maintaining a Clear Direction

Respondents mentioned:

- Unclear design and project requirements

- Lack of detail when sharing work with other team members

- Objectives and constraints getting lost in translation when communicating remotely

Advice:

- Clearly (and redundantly) communicate expectations and goals before, during, and after the workshop with written reminders, invitations, and verbal reminders

- Have a single source of truth so that all requirements, documentation, and updated designs live in one place

- Provide clear documentation when handing off designs: The audience will determine whether your documentation should be about how interactions will work or the importance of features to the business.

- Check in with team members frequently: Don’t be afraid to show incomplete or messy work.
