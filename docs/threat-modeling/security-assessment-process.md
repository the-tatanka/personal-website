# Security Assessment Process

## How to Ask Security Questions

We’re often in situations where crucial details are missing. This can lead to conflicts, especially after an inicdent.

Keep this in mind:

- People are more willing to reveal sensitive information when questions are asked in a decreasing order of intrusiveness.

- Ask questions on their terms - will the use of ISO and security jargon freeze the person into inaction?

- Checklists can help in stressful situations and prevent “creative” interpretations of your questions.
