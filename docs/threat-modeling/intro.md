# Intro

You threat model to identify threats to your component, which then lets you know where you need to concentrate your resources.

It doesn't solve the problem. The threats and risks are not solved until they are eliminated.

The section [Security Assessment](./security-assessment.md) explains how to perform threat modeling.

## Training materials
