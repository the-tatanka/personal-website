# Tooling

Threat modeling tools - in my opinion, an extremely overrated topic.

Essentially, you need to be able to draw a data flow diagram (DFD).

Being able to write down the threats and countermeasures is not a problem.

The following options are free:

- GitHub: With Mermaid.js support, a diagram can be created in markdown. Create DFD with Mermaid.js and note the threats in markdown.

- Almost any wiki platform: Draw DFD with a Draw.io integration.

- OWASP Threat Dragon: DFD can be drawn through joint.js. Drawing the trust boundaries is a bit buggy. Supports STRIDE.

- Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool: DFD can be drawn. Supports STRIDE. Is a desktop app :(.
