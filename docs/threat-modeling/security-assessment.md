# Security Assessment

The security assessment describes a detailed <b>detailed</b> threat modeling process - based on STRIDE.

## Writing a good Data Flow Diagram

Having a good diagram is key to a good threat model.

The first step is to draw a diagram of the flow of data in your component. It's the DATA flow you care about, NOT the code flow. Your threats come via data, NOT code.

Use the following elements:

- External Interactor: Is an element that is outside your area of control. It could be a user calling into an API, it could be another component (browser, user) but not one that's being threat modeled.

- Process: A process is simply some code (or microservice). It does NOT mean that it's a "process" as OS's call processes, instead it's just a collection of code.

- Data Store: A datastore is something that holds data.

- Data Flow: Represents the flow of data through the system.

- Trust Boundary: Occurs when one component doesn't trust the component on the other side of the boundary. There is always a trust boundary between elements running at different privilege levels.

- <i>Data: Could be a file, a registry key or personal data. This element does not appear in the classic data flow diagram. However, I find it helpful to explicitly model certain security relevant data.</i>

  - Data Stores store data
  - Processes process data.
  - Data Flows send Data.

## STRIDE

STRIDE stands for "Spoofing", "Tampering", "Repudiation", "Information disclosure", "Denial of service", and "Elevation of privilege".

| Threat                 | Property        | Definition                                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spoofing               | Authentication  | Impersonating something or someone else                  |
| Tampering              | Integrity       | Modifying data or code                                   |
| Repudiation            | Non-repudiation | Claiming to have not performed an action                 |
| Information Disclosure | Confidentiality | Exposing information to someone not authorized to see it |
| Denial of Service      | Availability    | Deny or degrade service to users                         |
| Elevation of Privilege | Authorization   | Gain capabilities without proper authorization           |

Essentially the idea is that you can classify all your threats according to one of the 6 STRIDE categories. But STRIDE is not a rigorous classification mechanism - there's a ton of overlap between the various categories (a successful Elevation of Privilege attack could result in Tampering of data, for instance). But it doesn't change the fact that it's an extremely useful mechanism for analyzing threats to a system.

It turns out that some STRIDE threats only apply to particular types of elements. If you think about it, it makes sense - for instance, an Elevation of Privilege threat doesn't apply to data stores (since a data store simply holds data, it operates at no privilege level).

For each element type, the following threats are considered valid:

| Element type      | S   | T   | R   | I   | D   | E   |
| ----------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| External Entities | X   |     | X   |     |     |     |
| Processes         | X   | X   | X   | X   | X   | X   |
| Data Stores       |     | X   | X   | X   | X   |     |
| Data Flows        |     | X   |     | X   | X   |     |
| Data              |     | X   |     | X   | X   |     |

There are common threats per STRIDE category. The following list is not complete and is only meant to be a help.

### Spoofing / Authentication

Broken authentication is an umbrella term for several vulnerabilities that attackers exploit to impersonate legitimate users. Broadly, broken authentication refers to weaknesses in two areas: session management and credential management.

For example, here are some common authentication methods and what would be required to spoof:

- Single key: Anyone who obtains the key would have access to the systems that trust it indefinitely.

- Access token: Anyone with an access token would have access before needing additional credentials to generate another token.

- Signatures: To spoof a signature, the attacker would need access to the sender's private key.

- Session ID: Attackers use stolen session IDs to impersonate identities.

The following types of attacks are considered authentication attacks:

- Brute Force: Allows an attacker to guess a person's user name, password, credit card number, or cryptographic key by using an automated process of trial and error. Weak of password policies simplify the attack.

- Insufficient Authentication: Allows an attacker to access a web site containing sensitive content or functions without having to properly authenticate with the web site - vulnerable authentication logic. Using a vulnerable authentication library. Missing rate limiters and lockout process. Insecure two-factor authentication. Uses plain text, encrypted, or weakly hashed passwords.

- Weak Password Recovery Validation: Allows an attacker to access a web site that provides them with the ability to illegally obtain, change, or recover another user's password.

- Insecure session handling: Authentication states are kept in a stateful session. Vulnerable session management allows a malicious user to ride on a valid authenticated session without the need for authentication. Improper user logout functionality, lack of session timeouts, insecure practices of storing session data in non httponly cookies, web pages, or browser storage are common attacks.

- Violation of the principle of least privilege: Access should only be granted for particular capabilities, roles, or users, but is available to anyone.

### Tampering / Integrity

When you retrieve data from a system, you should feel confident that it’s correct.

The following data is often tampered with:

- Access tokens: May be altered to spoof access.

- Updates / packages / plugins: Install malicious code.

- Logs: Overwrite log files that would show malicious activity.

- Business critical data: Billing addresses, ...

Common attacks are:

- Insufficient signature validation: An attacker can modify the contents at will, insert all kind of payloads (XSS, SQLi), ignore the expiration time by using an arbitrary value for the timestamp, and so on. Updates / packages / dependencies are downloaded and applied without sufficient signature verification.

- Injection: Cross-site Scripting and SQL Injection.

- Insecure Deserialization: Objects or data are encoded or serialized into a structure that an attacker can see and modify is vulnerable to insecure deserialization.

### Repudiation / Non-repudiation

### Information Disclosure / Confidentiality

### Denial of Service / Availability

### Elevation of Privilege / Authorization

## STRIDE-per-element

We call this process of considering the element-specific threats to each element in the DFD "STRIDE-per-Element".

And the best part about it is that STRIDE/element allows people to produce competent threat models with relatively little training.

The STRIDE-per-element methodology ends up creating a fair number of threats, even a component with a relatively tiny diagram. The good news is that many/most of those threats aren't meaningful threats.

This analysis is the core of the threat model, and where the real work associated with the process takes place.

## Risk Analysis

For each threat, the risk must be determined. The defined risk assessment methodology can be used for this purpose.

Risk is composed both of the impact when a risk is manifested as well as the likelihood that the risk will manifest. Impact can be assessed in a risk assessment and is primarily based on the data which the service handles. Likelihood on the other hand is primarily driven by the presence or absence of security controls in the service.

Risk is commonly defined as: <b>risk = impact \* likelihood</b>

For each identified threat, the risk must be assessed.

[The metrics and descriptions were taken from Mozilla.](https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/assessing_security_risk)

## Impact

Impact is the potential result that can be produced by the weakness, assuming that the weakness can be successfully reached and exploited.

Assessing impact is a relatively finite, quantitative exercise:

- define the maximum amount of how much money we might lose

- how badly our reputation would be damaged

- how many employees would be unable to work

- etc.

Risk impact generally does not change quickly over time unless services and products are redesigned, large features are added, new types of data is processed, etc.

| Level   | Description                                                                                                                |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| None    | There is no technical impact to the software being analyzed at all. In other words, this does not lead to a vulnerability. |
| Low     | Minimal control over the software being analyzed, or only access to relatively unimportant information can be obtained.    |
| Medium  | Moderate control over the software being analyzed, or access to moderately important information can be obtained.          |
| High    | Significant control over the software being analyzed, or access to critical information can be obtained.                   |
| Maximum | Complete control over the software being analyzed, to the point where operations cannot take place.                        |

## Likelihood

The likelihood that a vulnerability in the service will be exploited in a calendar year due to the absence of security controls.

| Level   | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| None    | Due to the absence of security controls, an attacker has no chance of success; i.e., the issue is a "bug" because there is no attacker role, and no benefit to the attacker.           |
| Low     | Due to the absence of security controls, an attacker probably would not target this weakness, or could have very limited chances of success.                                           |
| Medium  | Due to the absence of security controls, an attacker would probably target this weakness successfully, but the chances of success might vary, or require multiple attempts to succeed. |
| High    | Due to the absence of security controls, it is highly likely that an attacker would target this weakness successfully, with a reliable exploit that is easy to develop.                |
| Maximum | The absence of security controls will cause a risk.                                                                                                                                    |

## Risk

Risk is determined based on this risk metric.

The risk levels also represent a simplified ISO 31000 equivalent (and are non-compliant with ISO 31000).

| Level   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Risk Treatment

For each risk, the risk treatment option must be determined.

Risk treatment options:

- <b>Avoid</b> - deciding not to proceed with the activity that introduced the unacceptable risk, choosing an alternative more acceptable activity that meets business objectives, or choosing an alternative less risky approach or process.

- <b>Reduce</b> - implementing a strategy that is designed to reduce the likelihood or consequence of the risk to an acceptable level, where elimination is considered to be excessive in terms of time or expense.

- <b>Transfer</b> - implementing a strategy that shares or transfers the risk to another party or parties, such as outsourcing the management of physical assets, developing contracts with service providers or insuring against the risk. The third-party accepting the risk should be aware of and agree to accept this obligation.

- <b>Accept</b> - making an informed decision that the risk rating is at an acceptable level or that the cost of the treatment outweighs the benefit. This option may also be relevant in situations where a residual risk remains after other treatment options have been put in place. No further action is taken to treat the risk, however, ongoing monitoring is recommended.

In an ideal world, a risk treatment plan can be created. Unfortunately, this is usually unrealistic and creates more overhead than benefit.

What cannot be waived, however, is for each risk with the treatment option "reduce", to create issues / stories for the associated mitigations and to include the issue number in the security assessment report.

This ensures that the mitigations are in the backlog and are visible to the development team.

### Treatment Plan

Effective risk treatment relies on attaining commitment from key practice stakeholders and developing realistic objectives and timelines for implementation.

For each risk identified in the risk assessment, detail the following:

- Specify the treatment option agreed on - avoid, reduce, share/transfer or accept.

- Document the treatment plan - outline the approach to be used to treat the risk. Any relationships or interdependencies with other risks should also be highlighted.

- Assign an appropriate owner - who is accountable for monitoring and reporting on progress of the treatment plan implementation. Where the treatment plan owner and the risk owner are different, the risk owner has ultimate accountability for ensuring the agreed treatment plan is implemented.

- Specify a target resolution date - where risk treatments have long lead times, consider the development of interim measures. For example, it is unlikely to be acceptable for a residual risk to be rated ‘high' and to have a risk treatment with a resolution timeframe of two years.

### Mitigation

When using STRIDE, the following threat-mitigation table can be used to identify techniques that can be employed to mitigate the threats from [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process#determine-countermeasures-and-mitigation).

| Threat                 | Mitigation Techniques                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Spoofing               | Appropriate authentication, Protect secret data, Don't store secrets                             |
| Tampering              | Appropriate authorization, Hashes, MACs, Digital signatures, Tamper resistant protocols          |
| Repudiation            | Digital signatures, Timestamps, Audit trails                                                     |
