# Retrospective

After weeks or even months of effort to ship a big project, you and your team have thoughts. The retrospective template is where you can detail what went awesomely and what areas could have gone better. Use it to surface constructive criticism for a large, cross-team effort or even for a year in review.

Taken from [Confluence templates](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/templates/retrospective).
