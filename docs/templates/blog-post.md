# Blog Post

Taken from [Confluence templates](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/templates/marketing-blog-post).

Start with the easier stuff and fill out your blog post basics.

You don’t want to sink time and energy into blog posts just to have them sit there and collect digital cobwebs.

List the keywords you’re targeting, as well as the channels you’ll use to distribute your post. Make sure to list each channel individually so you can check it off when you’ve promoted the blog post there.

Start writing because the rest of the template is dedicated to the actual body of your blog post. Draft it right within the template, and you’ll ensure that all of the information that relates to that post stays in a centralized place.
