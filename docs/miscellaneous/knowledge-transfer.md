# Knowledge Transfer

Knowledge transfer within a company is a major challenge.

_I look for stuff, I know it's documented, I often don't find it._

You expect intranet search to work like Google, and you're disappointed when it doesn't. Lack of success diminished confidence and led you to abandon search altogether, assuming it wouldn't work.

Companies consist of teams and departments with different services and skills, as well as information. The aim is to make this information accessible and transparent to all colleagues.

For consultants only - of course the code documentation should be with the code itself. And yes, there is information that should not be available to all colleagues.

If a colleague notes the solution to a problem, other colleagues can benefit from it. Provided they find the solution.

There are many ways to organize the exchange of information. The most efficient solution is to use a company-wide wiki or tool. Then information can be easily searched for in this Wiki. As a single place of truth.

However, not all colleagues or teams agree to use one place to share information.

Nevertheless, colleagues must be provided with a simple and effective way to exchange information within the company - the **intranet search**.

Design practices for improving intranet search:

- Use a single search box for content, people, and tools

- Make it visible - use a search box, not just a search icon. Place it in the upper right corner of the global navigation menu

- Use type-ahead search suggestions that are quick, automatic, and non-intrusive

- The intranet-search page should be clean and uncluttered. Distinguish results for content, information about people, and links to digital workplace tools

- All intranet pages should have coherent metadata, including page titles, meta descriptions, and meta tags

- Dates alongside results help employees assess the recency and reliability of information

- Sort and filter values should be relevant and properly reorder or narrow the scope of the results

- Suggestions help users quickly recover from typographical errors

- Use pagination to display additional results instead of lazy loading or progressive reveals

- Benchmark the top-100 most searched keywords and review terms that yield no results

- Request feedback from users to improve
