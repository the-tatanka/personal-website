# Intro

> “I used to enjoy getting up in front of an audience,” ... “I loved working the room. Now, I feel like I’m speaking into a black hole.”
>
> Pre-Covid, when we presented in person, we could rely on the audience response to confirm that our message was being received. In virtual presentations, however, we lack audience feedback. We no longer see body language. We often don’t see people nodding their heads (or nodding off if they are bored) and it is much harder to make eye contact. As a result, we feel like no one is listening. Unfortunately, this makes us even more anxious about speaking. And even worse, because we feel as if no one is listening, we speak as if no one is listening. We sound less connected to the audience. We speak in more of a monotone. We ramble and have trouble finishing a thought. This only makes the problem worse — it both reinforces our anxiety and makes for a poor presentation. After all, the more disconnected we sound, the harder it is for the audience to listen.

> The answer is to virtually simulate the call and response function we experience during in-person presentations.
